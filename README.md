# Data Visualisation App

- under development....

# Overview

At 83 locations throughout the TSSG Headquarters at Waterford Institute of Technology West Campus, meters have been placed to monitor energy usage and environmental conditions.  The aim of the project is to build a distributed system that will accept the data from the meters, store it in a responsive, fault tolerant database, and to build a front end user interface that will visualise the data in a way that can make it easy for an end user to monitor in real-time and analyse respectively.

This is an application built using Node.js and AngularJS that will visualise the data coming from the meters. The goal of the application is to allow the front end user to design a personalised data visualisation page with their own choice of charts and graphs.

It is envisaged that the proposed system will lead to informed business decisions regarding the energy consumption throughout the companyâ€™s infrastructure that can hopefully lead to both energy and financial savings
